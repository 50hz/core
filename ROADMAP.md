*Please note that we have dropped support for our treeview, aggregations, grouping, filtering, sorting and analytics services in general. Our reasoning is defined [here](https://github.com/openfin/fin-hypergrid/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md). These existing services are being exported out of Openfin's github domain, but they will still be available for private forking by those interested.*
* We encourage folks to utilize our [Standard Tree Column](https://github.com/openfin/fin-hypergrid/pull/569) for building hierarchal views and utilizing hypergrid events as seen in this [demo](https://github.com/openfin/fin-hypergrid/blob/develop/demo/sorting-example.html#L68) (soon to be a wik) for developing a view on sorted, filtered, etc data.
