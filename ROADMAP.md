## Future development

* Eventing for triggering remote data transformations will be supported
* Hypergrid will be able to view hierarchical data 
* Remotely transformed (grouped/joined/aggregated) will be able to presented hierarchically
* Public APIs on Hypergrid.js will be refactored to a module pattern where related API calls are bundled together
* We will continue to iteratively add to the Wikis to fill in the large knowledge gap with the grid's features
* Hypergrid's eventing architecture will be simplified from its current implementation
* The state of the grid will be available in a serializable format
* The grid will re-implement the ability for theming that was originally a 1.0 Polymer feature
* Examples, Examples, Examples!!!
